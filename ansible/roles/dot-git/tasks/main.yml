# We're pulling the diff-highlight script from the "v2.13.2" tag rather
# than "master", because after this tag the script was split into a Perl
# module, and the actual diff-highlight script simply uses this module.
# It'd require slightly more work to install the Perl module _and_ the
# diff-highlight script, so I opted to use a slightly older version to
# ease the installation.
