# Taskwarrior program configuration file.
# For more documentation, see http://taskwarrior.org or try 'man task', 'man task-color',
# 'man task-sync' or 'man taskrc'

# Here is an example of entries that use the default, override and blank values
#   variable=foo   -- By specifying a value, this overrides the default
#   variable=      -- By specifying no value, this means no default
#   #variable=foo  -- By commenting out the line, or deleting it, this uses the default

# Use the command 'task show' to see all defaults and overrides

data.location=~/.task

#
# By default, the L priority is weighted above tasks with no priority at
# all. This change is to modify this behavior, such that L tasks are
# weighted lower than tasks without a priority. This allows tasks using
# the default priority (which is no priority at all) to be "demoted"
# using the L priority.
#
# Additionally, the M and H priority coefficients are listed here, but
# these values are unchanged from the default values. They're included
# here simply to be explicit about all of the priority coefficients, in
# case the default values ever change.
#
urgency.uda.priority.H.coefficient=6.0
urgency.uda.priority.M.coefficient=3.9
urgency.uda.priority..coefficient=1.8
urgency.uda.priority.L.coefficient=0

#
# We're not using the default urgency coefficient for blocking tasks
# because that will sometimes bump the urgency for these tasks above
# tasks that are due today, or overdue. I'd rather complete overdue
# tasks first, before working on tasks that are blocking, but not yet
# due or overdue.
#
# Likewise, since we're not bumping up the urgency of blocking tasks, we
# also don't want to bump down the urgency of blocked tasks.
#
# Finally, we want the blocking tasks to inherit the urgency of the
# tasks they're blocking. This way, tasks that are blocking a high
# urgency tasks, will also inherit that high urgency.
#
urgency.blocking.coefficient=0.0
urgency.blocked.coefficient=0.0
urgency.inherit=1

# Configuration required for integration with Inthe.AM, such that I can
# sync with a centralized server via "task sync". For more information,

# The following customizations are aimed at configuring the various
# reports to show a truncated description along annotation count, rather
# than the full desctiption and the actual annoations when displaying
# the reports. This is done by replacing the "description" field, with
# "description.truncated_count".
#
# The default columns are gathered with "task show $REPORT.columns",
# e.g. "task show completed.columns", and then that output is modified
# to do the replacement described above.
#
# It would be nice if this there was a way to do that replacement easily
# across all reports, but I'm not aware of any way to do that.
